# PlantArtistCorrelator
There is a list of plants (500). The list contains their common names, scientific names, any folk names, a paragraph about their use. VC++ also have access to a large list of artists. We need to collect a bunch of search results from the web and somehow determine which artist goes best with each plant. The thought thus far is to write a python script to crawl and conduct a lot of google search results and then process them to determine which are good results.
